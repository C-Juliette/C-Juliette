### Biographie

I am a data consultant at Business & Decision. I joined the teams through their Individual Operational Employment Preparation (POEI) program in Data Engineering, which allowed me to grasp data project management in industrial contexts.

Technologies: DevOps/DataOps/MLOps methodologies, Docker, Spark, Scala, Microsoft Azure, Git/GitHub, Jenkins, Terraform, and more.
I am currently certifying myself in Databricks and Scrum.

Previously, I completed the Master's program in Statistical Engineering at the University of Nantes, where I gained skills in R, R Shiny, Python, machine learning, and SQL databases.

The languages I have used most frequently are R and Python.

Long live the tidyverse, ggplot2, usethis, testthat, as well as scikit-learn, seaborn, and many others!
